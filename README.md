# odin-restaurant
A restaurant site made as part of The Odin Project's 'JavaScript' course.

- This project was created as an exercise in using JavaScript modules (imports and exports) and Webpack.
- The site consists of three tabs, changed by clicking navigation buttons. This will change the displayed content accordingly.
- The navigation buttons have styling to indicate which tab you're currently on.
- Each tab is created by importing information from other modules and using those modules to create images and information panels for quotes, menu items and more.
